Overview: (Refer to the full report for more details : [Report](<Bankruptcy Prediction Report - Final.pdf>))

Company’s financial data from the Taiwan economic journal for the years 1999 to 2009 was used as the dataset. The goal of the project was to find key features that helped to predict bankruptcy and to predict if companies will go bankrupt in the future. This will allow investors to invest safely into companies with very low chances of bankruptcy.

EDA & Data Analysis:

Data and statistical analysis were done on the dataset to figure out trends of bankrupt companies and for
feature extraction. Different Visualizations and graphs were made to explicitly show relation between different attributes and tell the story of bankrupt companies and how each attributes play’s its part in it. The dataset used was highly imbalance so we had to use different techniques like SMOTE and over
sampling to train the models

Models:

Few Models Used in the Project: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, XG Boost,
Cat Boost.

Results:

Recall is very important metric for Bankruptcy prediction and was the goal of our project as we want to filter out as many companies as possible that will go bankrupt in the future so that the investors can invest safely.
The end results achieved with this project were that we were able to predict bankruptcy in companies with 91 percent recall and 15 percent precision.
